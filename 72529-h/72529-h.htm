HOME OF THE SUGAR MAPLE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">To</span> the Green Mountain State belongs the honor of furnishing
the Maple its safest refuge and best home. Here it grows in
all its beauty and luxury of foliage. Here too, as the frosts
of fall settle upon our maple forests has the painters tried to copy
and place upon canvas the picture as the glossy green leaves turn to
red and gold. Once it reigned supreme as King of the forests of
Vermont. Thousands of acres once occupied by the sugar maple
have been cleared for agriculture, and the maple like the dusky
warrier has gradually been driven back to the hills.</p>

<p>Sugar maples have been transplanted to some extent in France,
Germany, Austria and England, with a view to adding sugar making
to their many lines of industries, but without satisfactory results.</p>

<p>Of all the trees of the forest the maple was the most valuable
to the early settlers. Its wood furnished the best fuel for their greedy
fireplaces. Also in the early days a considerable income was derived
from the burning of charcoal, and the maple made the best of material
for this. But even more than for all these purposes it lost its life
in the manufacture of potash. Not alone was the settlers’ great iron
kettles used for boiling down the sap of the maple into sugar, but were
principally used for boiling down the lye leached from wood ashes
into potash thus deriving a large income, although it resulted in the
same old story of killing the goose that laid the golden egg. But
alas! Not alone did the people of years gone by destroy and lay
waste our maple groves. The maple worm for several years stripped
our trees of their foliage, and bid fair to make sugaring a thing of
the past. But worst of all at the present time are the veneer mills,
which pay large prices for maple logs. And unless some means
be found to induce the farmer to spare his maple grove, the maple
Sugar industry of Vermont, like the Indian Brave who roamed at
will beneath their shade will have passed from among us.</p>

<p>Well may we cherish this grand old tree and be proud of sending
forth to the world an article which in its purity and delicacy of flavor
is unsurpassed by any sweetness otherwise produced.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_EARLY_HISTORY_OF_MAPLE_SUGAR">THE EARLY HISTORY OF MAPLE SUGAR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Vermont</span> has an enviable world wide reputation for the production
of two things: men and maple sugar. The noble
record of the former as given to us in history and also records
of the present day are known to all. But that the latter also has a
history of much interest is little known.</p>

<p>Along with the maize and tobacco, maple sugar had its origin
among the Indians. For time unknown before the white man came
to this continent the aborigines drew the sap of the maple tree and
distilled therefrom a sweet syrup. The various tribes of Canada,
Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan all knew of this art. Where ever
the white people came in contact with the Indians in a region where
the maple tree grew they found them making this delicious sweet,
and it was from them the white man learned the process.</p>

<p>The probable way in which the Indians discovered this art is
contained in one of their Legends, as given by Rowland E. Robinson
in the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite>:</p>

<p>“While Woksis, the mighty hunter was out one day in search
of game, his diligent squaw Moqua busied herself embroidering him
some moccasins. For the evening meal of her lord she boiled some
moose meat in the sweet water from a maple tree just by the wigwam.
Becoming interested in her work, she forgot the moose meat, and the
sweet water boiled away to a thick brown syrup.”</p>

<p>“When Woksis returned he found such a dainty morsel ready for
his supper, as he had never before tasted. The great chief eagerly devoured
the viand, licked the kettle clean and then went out and told
his tribe that Kose-Kus-beh, a heaven sent instructor, had taught
Moqua how to make a delicious food by boiling the juice of the maple.
And the discovery soon became known among all the Indians.” To
get the sap the Indians with their tomahawks cut a long slanting gash in
the tree, below the lower end of this gash a notch was cut to hold a chip
along which the sap would flow. The sap was caught in birch bark
dishes and boiled in earthen kettles. The small quantity of dark
syrup thus produced was the Indians only supply of sugar. Imagine
ourselves limited in this necessity of life to a little taste each spring,
and we can think what a delicacy their maple sugar must have been
to the Indian. We fondly anticipate the coming of this season of
the year, either for pleasure or profit. How long these anticipations
have existed in the hearts of men we know not, but we do know that
long before the foot of white man touched the virgin soil of New
England, long before the woodman’s axe echoed among our hills
and valleys, the dusky race, who freely roamed the primeval forest
gathered the maple sap in the primative way. It is not improbable
that the young braves and dusky maidens of the tribe, had sugar
parties, ate sugar upon snow and became sweet with each as do
the boys and girls at sugar parties today.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">THE PRIMATIVE METHOD, OF BOILING MAPLE SAP.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>The first white people to make maple sugar were the Canadians.
The manufacture of maple sugar in Vermont dates back to a very
early day; the first settlers like their neighbors in Canada first learned
the art of making it from the Indian, who they observed notching
the trees in the springtime.</p>

<p>For a hundred years or more the methods of production remained
without material change, save the substitution of iron or copper
kettles for vessels of clay or bark, and the use of better utensils. The
sugar was made merely for home use; cane sugar was a luxury and
often unobtainable by the pioneer farmer at any cost.</p>

<p>The trees were tapped with axes in the Indian way, the sap caught
in wooden troughs and gathered to some central place in buckets,
carried on the shoulders with a sap yoke; and if the snow was deep,
snow shoes were used to travel on; the boiling was done in large
iron kettles swung upon a pole in the open woods in some hollow
sheltered from the wind, with no protection from the sun, rain or snow,
and the numerous impurities of charcoal, ashes and leaves.</p>

<p>Although this was greatly in advance of the primative methods
of sugar making by the Indians, the product thus secured was dark
in color, strong in flavor, not altogether the flavor of the maple, and
quite variable in quality. This method with slight improvements
and modifications was principally used in the state until within the
past 50 years; since that time great improvements have been made.
But the boys and girls of today can scarcely realize the conditions
incident to the sugar season even 40 or 50 years ago, nor can they
fully realize the pleasures which this season brought to the young
people of those times, more especially the boys. In those days it
was no small matter to get ready for sugaring. Each wooden hoop
on the buckets must be tightened, with new hoops to replace the
broken ones. It required several days to soak the buckets and
make them hold the sap. The kettle, holders and buckets must
then be taken to the sugar orchard.</p>

<p>The boiling place must be shovelled out, and perhaps new posts
set for the lug pole on which to hang the kettles. Then the big back
logs must be hauled and some wood cut to start the boiling. A few
new sap spouts were needed each year, and these were made from
green sumac trees of proper size, and whittled to fit the auger hole;
the small pith being burned out with a redhot iron. With the inch
or three-fourths inch auger, one man could tap about 50 trees in a
day if he did not bore more than three inches deep, which was the rule.
If a new sap yoke was needed, a small basswood tree of right size was
cut, and the proper length for a yoke, halved, dug out to fit the neck
and shoulders, and the ends shaved to right dimensions. To make
“the yoke easy and the burden light” required a good fitting sap yoke.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that in the days gone by much work, and some
ingenuity were needed to get ready for sugaring. In those days
the sugar season called for hard work from the men and boys also
who were always required to do their part in gathering the nearby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
sap and tending the fires. But there were two sources of intense
enjoyment for the boys which largely compensated for the tired legs
in carrying the sap, and burnt faces and hands in tending fires.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image008" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image008.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">SUGAR HOUSE INTERIOR. BOILING SAP WITH PANS AND HEATER; NOW SLIGHTLY
OUT OF DATE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These were sugaring off times, one of which came any day towards
night, when the sap was gathered in, and father gave permission to
take some of the sweetest boiling from the big syrup kettle, and sugar
off in the little four quart kettle, which mother would kindly let us
take to the boiling place for that purpose. Some live coals were raked
from the big fire and the little kettle with its precious sweet was
placed thereon, and carefully watched until the sugar would blow
through a twig loop or lay on snow. The sugar was very dark and
often contained bits of charcoal that had fallen into the big kettles
in boiling, but that did not matter; it was sweet and the feast always
a delightful one. The other occasion was, in a measure, a sort of
state performance and generally occurred at the close of a good run
of sap, with fifteen or twenty buckets of syrup on hand. Early in the
morning the biggest kettle was taken from the boiling place, carefully
washed and set on three large stones. It was then filled about two-thirds
full of syrup and a fire started. When milk warm, six or eight
quarts of milk, with half a dozen well beaten eggs were added to the
syrup to “cleanse it.” Just before boiling was the skimming time,
when a pailful or more of dark thick scum would be taken from the
top of the syrup. About noon the boys, and oftentimes the girls also
would gather around the kettle to see it boil and taste the sweet as it
slowly thickened to sugar; but not until about two o’clock in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
afternoon would it be thick enough to lay on snow. In sugaring off
with the little kettle we did not always have as much sugar as we
wanted, but when the big kettle was on, we ate grained or waxed
sugar, and hot sugar and doughnuts, until we wanted no more. Only
those who have had these experiences can realize the intense enjoyments
of the sugar seasons of the years gone by.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/image009.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">MODERN SAP EVAPORATOR IN OPERATION.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Within the past 40 or 50 years, great improvements have been
made along the line of sugar implements; first the crude sugar shed
was built and the kettles were incased in an arch; then came the
large smooth bottom pans which were considered the height of perfection.
But the ever restless Yankee was not content with this.
First came the heater which heated the sap before it went into the
pans; next the crude form of evaporator, with wooden sides and
corrugations running across the pans but no opening beneath. Then
the evaporator of the present day of which there are many kinds, all
of which are good and capable of converting from twenty-five to a
hundred gallons of sap into syrup in an hour; this will be explained
later.</p>

<p>The bit of small size has taken the place of the axe, tapping iron
and large auger. The tin bucket with covers have placed in the background
the old troughs and wooden buckets. The team and lines of
piping have lightened the burden of the man with a sap yoke and
snow shoes, and instead of boiling out of doors or in the old shed a
comfortable, convenient plank floor sugar house is now used. Thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
we see the change which has taken place along the different lines
of the industry. It has worked itself into a trade or science and
men make a study of it. Therefore instead of the dark colored
article containing numerous flavors, the present product with the
modern methods is light in color, flavored only with the aroma of
the maple, and the fine qualities possessed by this article has already
won for itself a reputation far beyond the limits of our state. It has
already passed the point of being considered a necessity and its use
is now limited to those who can afford it as a luxury; even the poorest
quality the price per pound will purchase several pounds of cane
sugar for home use. Thus the poor farmer cannot use it except as a
delicacy. The total product of maple sugar in the United States
as stated in our census is about 50,000,000 pounds. Of this Vermont
is credited with about one-fourth of the entire output. We do not
wish to be misunderstood; all the pure maple sugar is not of this
fine quality; only the best grade which is a small percent of the
amount manufactured is entitled to the high prices received. The
small quantity of the so-called first class goods have led the producers
to grade their product, so that we have the first, second and third
grades with prices to compare with the quality; the reason of these
numerous grades are several. First, the chemical changes which
take place with the sap being exposed to the weather, the advance of
the season and last but not least, the many sugar makers who do not
take the care they should and who do not have the suitable machines
and utensils for making a No. 1 article.</p>

<p>The ever increasing demand for pure, genuine, first class maple
goods at a high price as compared to other sugars has led to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
making and placing upon the market numerous imitations of our
maple product, in which the poorer grade of maple sugar is used as a
flavoring. These goods often bear fraudulent labels in which it is
represented that they were manufactured in Vermont, though with
the exception of a few pounds used as flavoring, the stuff manufactured
of glucose and other compounds, never saw a maple tree in Vermont
or any other state.</p>

<p>This is the article placed upon the market in January and February,
marked “Vermont New Maple Sugar”. You may ask, how

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">If</span> Vermont is noted as being the home of any industry, that
industry is the production of maple sugar and syrup, and in
this booklet we will tell you something of the process of manufacture
and of whom you can procure this delicious luxury in all its
purity.</p>

<p>The producer must first have a grove of maple trees of the sugar
maple variety. These groves Vermont has in abundance. They are
on the hillside and in the valley; yet a grove of sugar maples that can
be utilized for sugar making cannot be produced in a few years, as
the tree is comparatively of slow growth and lives to a good old age.
Not many trees are used for sugar making until they are 40 years old,
and have a diameter of a foot or more. These are called second growth.
Then there are others, two, three or even four feet in diameter; sturdy
old trees that have withstood the storms of many winters. Some of
the trees used for sugar making purposes have been growing since
the Pilgrim Fathers landed in 1620.</p>

<p>Along in March of each year, the farmer begins to watch the
weather for signs of spring and conditions favorable to a flow of sap.
It can only be obtained for a period of a few weeks in the spring,
and on certain days when the weather conditions are favorable.
Snow usually lays on the ground when the sugarmaker begins his
operations in the sugar camp. The first step is to break roads in the
soft and thawing snow, so that the teams can get about and gather the
sap. This breaking roads is often no light task as the snow oftentimes
has icy crusts beneath the surface. After the oxen or horses have
been over the road several times and they have become somewhat
passable, the buckets are distributed one or two to a tree and the
sugar maker goes about his grove tapping them by boring a hole with
a bit three-eighths to one-half inch in diameter and two or three feet
from the ground as the snow will permit; in this hole he drives a
spout that conveys the sap to the bucket, and on which the bucket
usually hangs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/image012.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">TAPPING THE GROVE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When the sugar maker has finished tapping his trees he is ready
for a flow of sap. Sometimes it comes at once and then again the
weather may turn suddenly cold and for a week or ten days there
is nothing doing in the sugar camp; meantime he can get his boiling
apparatus in readiness and perhaps get a little more wood.</p>

<p>But spring will come sooner or later and there is bound to be a
rush of sap. Then comes the busy time in the camp; the men and boys
gather the sap with oxen and horses. This is usually done with a
tank holding from 20 to 40 pails on a sled and drawn to the sugar house
and stored in tanks from which in turn it flows to the boiling pan
or evaporator; the flow from the storage tank being regulated by feeders
which keeps the boiling sap in the evaporator constantly at the same
level. The sap as it boils passes from one compartment to another
becoming more dense and sweeter until it reaches the syruping off pan,
where it is drawn off in the form of syrup. The right density can be determined
by a thermometer or the skilled operator can tell by the way
the syrup “leather aprons” from the edge of the dipper. If the thermometer
is used a temperature of 219° F. will give a syrup that will weigh
eleven pounds to the gallon net. It must be remembered, however,
that the thermometers are graduated at the sea level, and as the
altitude increases a lower temperature will give the same result
on account of the reduced air pressure. An allowance of 1° for every
500 feet rise has been found to be about right; thus at an altitude of
1,000 feet a boiling temperature of 217°F. will give the 11 pounds
syrup. Syrup is not however usually brought to the required density
in the evaporating pan but is drawn off a little less than 11 pounds net,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
and brought to a uniform standard in larger quantities than would
be possible in the evaporating pan. The fire under the boiling sap
should be quick and hot, as the sooner it is reduced to syrup after it
runs from the tree the better the product. As the sap begins to boil
a scum of bubbles rises to the top, which must be constantly removed
with a skimmer, and the man who tends the fires, skims the sap and
draws off the syrup has a busy job.</p>

<p>When the sap has been reduced to syrup having a density of about
11 pounds to the gallon, the niter or malate of lime, sometimes called
sugar sand, which is held in solution in the sap and which crystalizes or
precipitates at this stage of evaporation, can be separated from the
syrup. This is accomplished in two or more ways; some strain
it through felt while hot and leave the syrup free of niter; others
let stand in buckets or tanks until cold; then turn or draw off the
clear amber syrup leaving the malate of lime at the bottom.</p>

<p>Nothing has as yet been said about sugaring off, but this is a
process by itself and comes after we get the syrup. Anyone who has
maple syrup can sugar off, as the saying is, or convert the syrup to
sugar by boiling it.</p>

<p>In the sugar camp the sugaring off is usually done in a deep pan
on a separate arch, as the boiling sugar has a tendency to boil over
unless constantly watched. The size of the pan depends on the form
of product to be made. If the sugar is to be put in tin pails or wood
tubs it can be handled in lots of 100 pounds or more; this would require
a pan 12 inches high, 2 feet wide and 4 feet long. For shipping long distances
or to hot climates the sugar should be cooked down to a density
of 240° to 245°F. Great care is necessary however, not to burn or
scorch the sugar when cooked to so high a temperature. For ordinary
purposes if the sugar is to be used soon after it is made a temperature
of 235° to 238° is high enough.</p>

<p>When making small cakes it is better to have two or more smaller
pans and have the batches of sugar done at different intervals as the
color and grain of the cake sugar depend largely on the amount of
stirring it gets while hot and the sooner it is stirred after it is done
the better. When the sugar gets so thick that it will barely pour it is
run into moulds where it soon hardens and is ready to be wrapped in
waxed paper, packed in boxes and sent to market.</p>

<p>There is another form of sugar, and no sugar party is complete
without it, that is sugar on snow or ice. Boil the syrup down a
little past 230°, cool it and put on snow with the spoon. When
cooled, the waxed sugar eaten with an occasional plain doughnut
and now and then a pickle is a pleasure long to be remembered and a
banquet fit for a King.</p>

<p>To be sure and get the pure goods, order direct from the producer
or from the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers’ Market, Randolph, Vt.,
where maple goods can be procured at any season of the year.</p>

<p>This market is the outgrowth of and closely connected with the
Vermont Maple Sugar Makers’ Association.</p>

<p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">E. Wellman Barnard</span>, Open Ridge, Springfield, Vt.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> Vermonters congregate at some special social function
when responses are expected concerning the state and its
products, the speakers may be relied on to advance at least
the claim of excellence for the men it sends to other states and countries
to become noted factors in the land of their adoption; for its gracious
women; for its pure bred Morgan horses and its far famed maple
sweets. These claims are in a great measure valid and the inborn
pride that vouches for them is pardonable, for of the first it is only
necessary to consult municipal, state and national Blue Books to find
corroborative evidence; the second are known the world around in art
and song and story. The supple Morgan, elastic to the tread of his
native hills, with arching neck and prancing feet, an ear for martial
music, and an intelligence too often of a higher degree than his master,
has enlivened the trotting and road stock of the country. It is of the last
product and the environment of its manufacture we will treat. Vermont
has become as justly celebrated for its fine flavored maple
products, as for the silky fibre of its merino wool. For the climate
and soil contribute to that end as much as do the soils and climate
of Cuba and Sumatra to the delicate aroma of smoking tobacco, and it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
safe to say that nowhere in the known world do these exact conditions
occur to such a great degree as in the section which comprises
upper New England and some portions of New York and Canada.
There is probably no crop dependent upon the elements, so sensitive
to and actuated by meteorological conditions as this, from the day the
bud of the maple bursts forth a tiny leaf in May or June to the day
of sap flowing in the March or April following. The summer’s heat
is quite as essential as the winter cold, for the former makes the
starchy growth to the tree that the latter converts into sugar, and
while the sugar maker is blistering in his hay field in mid-summer or
putting up the fires to keep out 30° below zero temperature when winter
shuts him in, he knows the right forces are at work in nature’s laboratory
to produce his sugar crop, and is so patient in his discontent. The
sugar season may commence early in March or it may be delayed until
April, all again “depends on the weather.” The old time saying “When
ye ancient moon of April shall glow so shall ye maple sap in abundance
flow,” often holds good, but when it sometimes happens there are two
last quarters of a moon in April the sugar maker can take his choice
as to which he will close the harvest.</p>

</figure>

<p>As the sun advances northward from its long southern sojourn
and the north and south winds lock and interlock for supremacy,
the frost and fury line gradually recedes and the more direct actinic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
rays of the sun thaws out the hard frozen timber, the crows hold
their annual matrimonial pow-wow for pairing; blue birds come and
a snow crust often forms at night hard enough to hold a man if not
a team. It is then the sugar maker begins to think of his annual effort.</p>

<p>All up-to-date plants have substantial buildings, running water
and heaters for washing; use galvanized iron tanks for gathering and
storage; galvanized iron or tin buckets and sap spouts and also one
of the more modern evaporators. This often represents a cash outlay
quite sufficient to handle some business in town and is in use only
two or three weeks in the year, the rest of the time being idle unless
the owner includes the making of cider apple jellies in the fall and
provides himself with a copper evaporator for the purpose.</p>

<p>If the sugar maker has been wise he has erected his sugar house
along side a bank or declivity at least 30 feet high and easy of approach
so that he can handle all the sap by gravity from the gathering tank
downward to the straining tank and on to the holding tanks and then
into the evaporator; each being well below the other. He uses an
iron arch and stack which he keeps well coated with asphalt varnish
to prevent rust and in case the draft of his arch is not good uses a
Fenn rotary chimney top on his stack. Of course he has an ample
supply of wood fuel that has been provided a year or more in advance
under an adjoining shed so that it may be <em>very</em> dry for a quick fire is
one of the main factors of rapid evaporation so necessary for good
product, and another quite as important is that the evaporator
room be built for it, with a space of about 5 feet all around it, and the
walls sealed close to make a hot air draft upward. He does not need
to kill the goose that lays the golden egg by providing sound rock
maple wood. Any timber will do if dry; old dry pine stumps are the
<em>ne plus ultra</em> and hemlock boughs, a good second.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">AT THE CLOSE OF THE SEASON; BUCKETS DRYING IN THE SUN.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The competent sugar maker has thoroughly cleansed all his
apparatus when he put it up at the end of the season before, but many
things will need a new scald. The buckets however, and spouts are
usually ready for business if properly stored after a little dusting at
short notice and this is most important and often saves the first run
of sap, and here let me add, the competent sugar maker must be as
alert and use as much care and forethought as the competent hay
maker, who <em>cures</em> hay rather than “handles it”. Afterthought does
not count at sugaring except for the next season, but then again
scatter brains has poor memory. Our city cousin whom we gladly
greet in our homes in the “good old summer time” has lost some of
the joys of the round of the country season if he has not been on hand
on the morning of some fine spicy day when through the brilliant
mirror-like atmosphere Mount Washington looks like the Jungfrau,
standing aloft in the grand circle of the green and granite mountains of
New England so reminiscent of Switzerland, and robin red breast is
back to his old home sending forth cheery notes of greeting to go
along with the sugar maker and his big load of buckets to the sugar
bush, over a road that has been shoveled or plowed or broken through
the deep snows on a thawy day ready for the event and in the early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
morn, while the snow crust will hold up and with plenty of helpers
the buckets, perhaps a thousand or more, are hung. The men who
tap the trees with the wide swing bit stock and 7-16 bit, but have
the experience and adeptness to quickly select new growth timber
in the old tapped tree and also to secure an upright resting place for
the bucket. The spout men must never chaffer the tree into the
inner bark and must not injure the spout when driving it securely in.
The bucket should be properly placed and kept so at all future gatherings
of sap. There is some discussion pro and con as to the convenience
and necessity of covers, but they save lots of trouble in
stormy weather and save much good sap that otherwise would be
wasted. The coming bucket will be a large one, holding more then
20 quarts, perfectly covered, well flared for ice expansion and compression,
concaved on one side to fit the tree and having in the bottom a
flat, sap tight, easily worked faucet that will discharge quickly all the
sap into the gathering pails without disturbing the bucket. Inventors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
take notice. Our city friend may take a hand at gathering and note
the necessity of getting the sap from tree to evaporator quickly and
holding it in as low temperature as possible to prevent acids inherent
to the tree circulation getting in adverse chemical action and detrimenting
the product. It is a good plan to have good, clean chunks
of ice on hand to keep in storage tanks although at times it will not be
required because of the low temperature prevailing. The ideal sugar
weather is 25° at night and 55° during the day with damp northerly
winds.</p>

<p>Now as the sap has commenced running our guest will soon
realize that the whole proposition and output depends strictly on the
weather conditions. A shift of the wind; a change in temperature or
humidity and especially a change of barometer pressure, which is the
actual force behind a rapid flow of sap, may turn a big sap day into a
complete fiasco and perhaps the often reoccurrence, a whole season,
and thus the competent sugar maker with his $30 per month and board
“help” and $4.00 per day teams may be quite out of pocket at the
end of the season for no cause of his own, even though he obtain $1.50
per gallon for his canned syrup; but then he may charge all this up
in his profit and loss account along with his products of milk and cream
for the city contractor often backing up the latter with a mortgage on
his farm the grain, help and imposed conditions account that the mill
may go around by day and year.</p>

<p>Has it ever occurred to the city consumer that the modern dairy
building and apparatus so glibly demanded will cost from $3,000 to
$5,000 according to locality, for a herd of 25 cows often more than
the whole farm does sell for at auction after such improvement has
been added. And this holds good as to the sugar output; $1,000 goes
a short way for a 2,500 tree establishment and it is the many full
buckets that count against short runs, rather than a smaller number
with less initial expense. Moreover it should be borne in mind by the
town consumer that the farm price demanded has never been exorbitant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
for any product and that for at least a quarter of a century has
ruled so dangerously low that no other business or calling that did not
have its habitation and crude food products included in the output
would have stood up to it for a season; but then, there is the middleman
who is often a needless or exaggerated adjunct that in many
lines has become an avaricious parasite to legitimate business—but
that is another story and our city friends can help us solve that after
they have canvassed the situation by actual contact, and with benefit
to themselves.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PRESENT_STATUS_OF_THE_INDUSTRY">PRESENT STATUS OF THE INDUSTRY.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">By Dr. Harvey W. Wiley.</span><br>
(<cite>From the Government Bulletin.</cite>)</p>

<h3>Development of Present Conditions.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Maple</span> sugar was made by the early settlers as an article of food,
the West Indian cane sugar being costly and difficult to
transport inland. The commonest kind of “muscovado,”
however, was preferred to maple sugar, if it could be obtained. With
the increased supply of cane sugar there is little doubt that maple sugar
would have almost ceased to be a commodity on the market but for its
peculiar flavor, which, while objectionable for general purposes, created
a special demand. Thus, while the cheaper and unflavored cane product
has almost displaced maple sugar as an article of food, the demand
for maple syrup and sugar as luxuries and flavoring materials not only
keeps the industry alive, but calls for a continually increasing supply.</p>

<p>It would naturally be supposed that this growth in demand would
have been followed by a corresponding increase in production. Such,
however, is not the case; while the demand for maple sugar and syrup
is continually increasing, the production has been more or less stationary
for twenty years. The explanation lies in the fact that, at the
very lowest estimate, seven-eighths of the product sold today is
a spurious article, which is only in part maple sugar, or is manufactured
entirely from foreign materials.</p>

<p>When maple sugar began to come into general demand, the market
fell naturally into the hands of the wholesale dealers. The farmers
were unorganized, and, as a rule, out of touch with the consumers.
Consequently the sugar, made in the early spring, when the farmer
was most in need of ready money, was generally either sold to the
country store at a low price, or exchanged for cane sugar, pound for
pound, irrespective of general market conditions. It was then bought
again by the “mixers” and used to flavor a body of glucose or cane
sugar six or ten times as great, making a product which was marketed
as “pure maple sugar.” The mixers preferred to buy a dark, inferior
sugar, because it would go further in the mixture. If the season was
bad they bought less, but at almost the same price, and increased the
proportion of the adulterant. Thus a shortage in the maple sugar crop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
has no effect whatever on the general supply. It is also true that
while the trade in maple sugar has been steadily growing, the production
from the trees has remained stationary. The mixer controls
the situation, with the effect of lowering the profits of the farmer,
preventing a compensatory increase in price when the crop is short,
and retarding progress in the industry by the demand for a low-grade
tub sugar.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image022" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

LARGEST GROVES IN NORTHERN VERMONT.<br>
(Continuation of this picture on opposite page.)</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But there has always been a certain amount of trade in pure maple
sugar and syrup. A part of the city and town population comes from
the country, where they have known the genuine article, and they
have generally been able to supply their wants by dealing directly
with the producers. The progressive and well-to-do sugar maker has
also worked in this field. Of course there are farmers and others who,
having pride and capacity, do their utmost to produce the best goods
and market them in the most advantageous manner. Such sugar
makers are unwilling to sell their high-grade goods to the mixers at a
low price, but make every effort to reach a steady market of regular
customers.</p>

<p>In the effort to make such a market more general, several maple
sugar makers’ associations have come into existence. That of Vermont
is the most notable. The annual meetings of this society have
done much to stimulate improved methods, as well as to build up a
legitimate trade. The association has established a central market,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
has adopted a registered trade-mark, and guarantees absolute purity.
Its trade, through advertising and other business methods, has
reached good proportions. But there is only a very small part of the
business, even at the present time, which is not in the hands of the
mixers.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">MAPLE SUGAR CAMP IN ONE OF THE<br>
LARGEST GROVES IN NORTHERN VERMONT.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The following quotations are from the testimony of Mr. Madden
before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce,
Fifty-seventh Congress, pages 85 and following:</p>

<p>Mr. Madden. I would like to speak to you a moment in regard
to maple syrup. That is a subject that will undoubtedly interest you
all. We are in a very peculiar position in regard to maple syrup.
We do not believe it is right that a syrup composed of maple syrup
made from either the sap of the maple tree or from maple sugar and
mixed with glucose should be sold as a maple syrup; but we do believe
that a maple syrup made from syrup of the maple sugar and mixed with
cane-sugar syrup or refined-sugar syrup, I will say—because beet and
cane sugar are the same after they have been through boneblack—we
do believe that should be sold for maple syrup, and I will tell you
why. In the first place, the amount of sap of maple syrup—that is,
syrup that is made from boiling the sap of the maple tree without converting
it into sugar—is so limited that it would not, in my judgment,
supply more than 5 percent of the demand for maple syrup in the
United States.</p>

<p>Now, when maple sap is boiled into sugar—and I want to say
before I go further that the reason that the amount of sap syrup<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
is so limited is because it is hard to keep it from fermentation, and the
season is so short in which the sap runs that it is difficult to manufacture,
to boil enough in the camps to supply the demand; consequently
a large proportion of the sap in the States where maple sugar is made is
boiled into maple sugar. Now, we have found by experience—not
by chemical analysis, but by experience—that the maple sugar
made from the sap of the maple tree in Ohio is not so strong as the
maple sugar made from the sap of the maple tree in Vermont, and that
the maple sugar made from the sap of the maple tree in Vermont is
not so strong in flavor as that which is made in Canada, in Quebec
Province, because it seems the colder the climate, the stronger in
flavor the maple sap is.</p>

<p>Now, we buy these various sugars and reduce them to a liquor
to make maple syrup, and I will give you my word, gentlemen, if we
take a Canadian sugar, which is the highest priced maple sugar we
have, it being worth at the present time twelve cents a pound, while
Vermont is worth only eight cents a pound—I give you my word
that if we make a liquor by melting that Canadian maple sugar, without
the addition of sugar to reduce the strength of the flavor, it is so strong
you could not use it.</p>

<p>Mr. Coombs. What do you mean by strong?</p>

<p>Mr. Madden. Strong in flavor.</p>

<p>Mr. Coombs. You mean it is positive?</p>

<p>Mr. Madden. The flavor is so positive; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. Coombs. And it is sweet?</p>

<p>Mr. Madden. Sweet, yes; but if you put it on a hot cake you
would say right away, “Take it away; I won’t have such stuff,” and
you would ordinarily say that it was glucose. You would be wrong,
but that is what you would say.</p>

<p>Now the Vermont sugar is not so strong, and it does not require
so much cane sugar to reduce that to a flavor comparing with the
natural maple syrup obtained from the sap itself; and I tell you that
we can take maple sugar and reduce it, blending it with cane sugar—and
by that I mean take ordinary cut-loaf sugar, for instance, and melt
it—and we can take this syrup that is made by melting the maple
sugar and blend it with the white syrup, and we can produce a maple
syrup that is in flavor strong enough and yet delicate enough to satisfy
the appetite, and that, in my judgment, is better than the sap syrup
made from the maple tree for a great majority of the people.</p>

<p>As an illustration, although we get $11.50 per dozen gallons for a
sap maple syrup that is boiled from the sap of the maple tree and the
character of the maple syrup that I have just described, about 95
percent of our business is on the syrup that is made from the maple
sugar and the cane sugar rather than on the syrup made from the
sap itself. Now, if we have to take this maple syrup and brand it as
cane sugar, or have any such restrictions, we can not sell it. Now,
what are we going to do? We do not believe in frauds any more than
you do. We think just as much of our reputation as you do of yours;
but we do not want to be held responsible for conditions that we have
not built up.</p>

<p>Mr. Coombs. It seems to me your whole argument has illustrated
that everybody who buys these things knows he is not buying the pure
article.</p>

<p>Mr. Richardson. It is either that or you are deceiving them, one
or the other.</p>

<p>Mr. Madden. Well, I will answer another phase of that question.</p>

<p>Now, it is commonly assumed, I think, that these blends, mixtures,
substitutes, and what some of our theoretical gentlemen call commercial
frauds, are done for the purpose of palming off on the people
something that is cheap or inferior at a high price. Right there is
where the mistake is made. The profits on that class of goods are less
to us than on the higher class and more expensive goods, because
competition forces these lower-class commodities down to such an
extent that they pay us less profit than any other.</p>

<p>We could not take a maple sugar and mix it with cane sugar and
obtain the price for pure maple-sugar syrup unless it had the quality,
unless it cost so much. In other words, in speaking of maple syrup—and
here is the part of this I forgot to speak of—if you take maple
sugar and reduce it to the liquor, as we call it, and had to sell it without
the addition of any reducing sugar or white syrup—not glucose, but
pure cane or beet sugar—if you have to sell it without doing that,
it would be so expensive as to be prohibitory, because with Canadian
maple sugar worth twelve cents a pound today, it taking eight pounds
of it to make a gallon of syrup, you would have a price of nearly a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
dollar a gallon for your liquor as a first cost, without the cost of package.
* * *</p>

<p>The above quotations will illustrate sufficiently well the processes
of manufacturers and dealers in adulterating maple syrup. It is
evident from this testimony that if the pure article be obtained when
purchased at random it is by accident rather than by intention. Whatever
may be the condition of the products when they leave the manufacturers
in Vermont, New York, Ohio, or Canada, it is evident that
all that part which goes into general commerce is subject to extensive
adulterations. Only that part which enters domestic commerce, that
is sold directly by the manufacturer to the consumer, can be considered
above suspicion.</p>

<p>It is evident from the above résumé of the subject that the adulteration
of maple syrup is practiced to an enormous extent. As stated
by one of the witnesses, it is doubtful if more than 5 percent of the
amount sold in this country is the genuine article. It is evident that
the makers of the genuine article are forced into competition with
these extensive adulterations, thus lowering the legitimate price. Every
grove of maple trees in the United States would be worth a great deal
more to its owner if the state and national laws should be so framed
as to eradicate this great evil. Such laws would permit the sale of
these mixed goods under their proper names, and thus protect both
the manufacturer and consumer.</p>


<h3>Necessity for Sugar Makers’ Organizations.</h3>

<p>With a steadily growing demand for maple syrup, which today is
almost entirely supplied by the mixer, the producers of pure syrup
can hope to control the trade only through organization. The difference
between the pure and the adulterated product is so marked that
there would be little question as to choice, with the genuine sugar
known to the popular trade. A large number of the consumers
hardly know pure maple syrup when they taste it, and as so great a
part of that on the market is spurious, they have little chance to
learn. Under such a condition the market can be gained for the pure
product only by means of united action. An example of such action
is the present Vermont Sugar Growers’ Association.</p>

<p>The situation is very similar to that which has already been successfully
met, in the case of certain other farm products, by organized
cooperation of producers. Sometimes, as in Germany and Canada,
this has been initiated and substantially aided by government action;
sometimes, as in Ireland and England, it has been carried through
entirely by private enterprise. Some years ago Canadian dairy
products formed but an insignificant proportion of the exports of
these articles to Great Britain. Now, through the efforts of the
Canadian government to foster intelligent and honest methods of
production, an English market has been secured for the Canadian output.
The Irish Agricultural Organization Society has gone far
toward bringing about an economic regeneration of the island, and in
Germany rural prosperity has been vastly increased by the same methods.
In all these cases the principal purposes aimed at have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
the improvement of methods of production, and furnishing a guaranty
of purity to consumers.</p>

<p>In the case of maple sugar producers the first necessity is a market
for high grade, unadulterated sugar and syrup. This they should be
able to secure without much difficulty through responsible association,
which can guarantee the quality of all the product bearing its name
or stamp. * * *</p>


<h3>The Amount of Sugar in Maple Sap.</h3>

<p>Maple sap is a nearly colorless liquid composed of water, sugar and
various mineral substances, such as lime, potash, magnesia, and iron;
it also contains some organic matter in the form of vegetable acids.
The peculiar flavor of maple sugar comes, not from the sugar, but
from some one or a combination of all the other substances contained
in the sap.</p>

<p>The amount of sugar in the sap of the average sugar maple tree
varies greatly, the percentage changing in each tree as the season progresses.
Careful experiments have shown that the sap contains on an
average about 3 percent of sugar. The maximum is reported at 10.2
percent, which was found in a small flow of sap from a sugar maple
near the end of a season, during which the tree averaged 5.01 percent.</p>


<h3>The Manufacture of Sugar and Syrup.</h3>

<h4><em>The Sap Season.</em></h4>

<p>The sap season throughout the maple sugar belt of the United
States generally begins about the middle of March and continues until
the third week in April but it varies very widely with a late or an
early spring. Sugar making has begun as early as February 22 and as
late as the first week in April. The season lasts on an average about
four weeks. The longest run on record included forty-three days,
and the shortest eight days.</p>

<h3>THE VERMONT MAPLE SUGAR MAKERS’
ASSOCIATION.</h3>

<p>Was organized at Morrisville, Vermont, January, 1893. The
object of this association is to improve the quality and increase the
quantity of the maple product of the state, and to protect the manufacturer
and consumer from the many fraudulent preparations that are
placed upon the markets of this country as pure maple sugar and
syrup, and to inform the general public where the genuine article can
be procured. The members of this association consist of the best
manufacturers of maple sugar and syrup in the state, and their names
and post-office address may be found in this work, and any dealer
or consumer ordering sugar or syrup from them will be sure to get
that which is pure and free from adulteration.</p>

<p>The association owns and issues a protected label to its members
upon their agreement, filed with the secretary, that they will only use
it upon packages containing pure maple sugar or syrup, of standard
quality, of their own manufacture, a copy of which label will be found
in this work, and a purchaser of a package covered by this label may
be assured of its purity. The improper or unauthorized use of this
label or any adulteration of the products covered by the same will be
prosecuted to the full extent of the law by the association.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h3>QUALITY OF MAPLE SUGAR.</h3>

<p>While it is true that the sugar product of the state has improved
greatly within the past few years, it is also true that there is considerable
of the product at the present time that does not show the improvements
that have been noted. It is one of the rules of the Vermont
Maple Sugar Makers’ Association that no member shall use the label
of the association on goods of an inferior quality, and a member who
does so use it is liable to be expelled from its membership; therefore,
it is well to insist upon packages bearing this label, and customers
are requested to report to the secretary of the society any case of
receiving poor goods bearing this label. While it is the first object
of the association to improve the quality of maple products, and increase
the quantity now produced, which can easily be doubled, it
recognizes as of the utmost importance that it should place before the
consumers the knowledge which shall enable them to secure pure goods
instead of an imitation product.</p>

<p>The fact that there is more of the spurious than of the genuine
sold at the present time shows that there is chance for abundant work
in that direction, and the officers of the association will always be glad
to aid customers in placing their orders when requested so to do, as
far as practicable, a medium of information between producer and
customer in which it is hoped that each will receive an advantage.</p>

<p>Maple goods as put up in Vermont, are in three general classes.
1. The syrup or maple honey is put up and sealed in air-tight tin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
cans or in glass, the usual form being the gallon tin can either round
or oblong and the syrup in these cans should weigh eleven pounds net
to the gallon or about eleven and three-fourths pounds including can.
Pure syrup varies to quite an extent in color. The first run of sap
usually produces syrup of a lighter color than is produced later in the
season. The color also depends upon the method used in collecting the
sap and boiling it and, other things being equal, the less time that is
allowed between the production of the sap and its conversion into
syrup or sugar the whiter will be the product. Were it possible to convert
sap to sugar without any lapse of time or exposure to the air the
product would be perfectly white. There has been a suspicion among
people who are familiar with Vermont maple products of the last
generation that the present goods were not pure because so much
whiter than formerly, but the change is due entirely to the improved
and more rapid methods of manufacture.</p>

<h3>PURE MAPLE SUGAR.</h3>

<p>There is practically no adulteration of maple sugar in Vermont.
The state has a stringent law on the subject and the maple sugar
makers of the state will tolerate no infringement of its provisions, so
that the customer can feel great security in ordering sugar or syrup of
producers or dealers in the state, and can feel absolute security in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
ordering these goods of any of the members of the Vermont Maple
Sugar Makers’ Association, bearing the label of the association. The
name and post-office address of all the members of the association will
be found in this booklet.</p>

<h3>DIRECTIONS FOR THE CARE OF MAPLE SUGAR AND
SYRUP.</h3>

<p>Sugar. To keep maple sugar in a warm climate, store in as cool
and dry a place as possible. If in tin and tightly covered it will
mould and ferment on top. To prevent this the best method is to
take off the covers and paste over the top of the can a piece of strong
manila paper. This will also serve to keep out the ants. Tubs with
covers are not as liable to ferment, but is it well to treat them in the
same manner.</p>

<p>Syrup. Syrup should be put in air-tight packages and kept
so until used. If the syrup is received packed in sawdust the best
method is to leave it in the original package and store in a dark cool
place, until needed for use, and if it is put up in glass be very careful
to keep it from the light. If for any reason the syrup should begin to
ferment, which will be known in the case of tin packages by a bulging
of the head of the can called “swelled-head” it should be borne in mind
that it is not necessarily spoiled as would be the case with fruit, but
by heating it to a boiling temperature the fermentation can be arrested
and the original flavor, to a great extent, restored. And in this
connection it may be said that either syrup or sugar, which has been
kept for some time, will be greatly improved in flavor by the same
treatment.</p>

<h2>PURE FOOD AND DRUG LAW.</h2>
</div>

<p>Vermont has a Pure Food and Drug law which strictly prohibits
the adulteration and misbranding of food products including maple
sugar and syrup. (Public Statutes of Vermont, sections 5466 to
5494 inclusive.)</p>

<p>Purchasers of maple products made in Vermont may rest assured
that they are as represented, and made from the sap of the maple
tree and nothing else. The maple sugar and syrup produced in
Vermont is not only pure but it has a delicacy of flavor and aroma
not found in the same product made in other localities. This fine
flavor is the result of the soil and climatic conditions to be found in the
State.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2>MAXIMS FOR MAPLE SUGAR MAKERS.</h2>
</div>

<p>Be in readiness to get the first run.</p>

<p>Have all utensils thoroughly cleansed and scalded.</p>

<p>Employ none but competent and experienced men to tap your
trees.</p>

<p>Cut away the rough bark, only, before tapping, leaving bark
sufficiently thick to hold the spout firmly to prevent leaking.</p>

<p>The finest flavor and lightest color will be obtained by shallow
tapping.</p>

<p>Gather often, boil at once. Every delay in the process of evaporating
sap will injure more or less the <em>quality</em> of the sugar.</p>

<p>Always strain your sap. Use felt strainers for syrup. Boil
down to 11 pounds per gallon; test by a correct thermometer, and
can hot to prevent crystalizing in bottom of the can.</p>

<p>Give full gallon measure and ship only <em>standard</em> goods to your
best trade.</p>

<p>Use a reliable thermometer. It is as indispensable in the sugar
house as in the dairy.</p>

<p>Use tin or painted buckets and the best improved metallic spout.</p>

<p>The bucket cover has come to stay. Use them, they will save
their cost in one season.</p>

<p>Join your State Maple Sugar Makers’ Association, and attend the
convention.</p>

<p>Do not think that you know it all, for maple sugar making is a
science about which you may learn something every season if you are
observing.</p>

<p>One pound maple sugar, 1 pint of water, boil ten minutes, skim and cool.</p>


<h3>Maple Sugar Ice Cream.</h3>

<p>One quart cream, 2 cups maple sugar, 2 eggs, 1 pint of milk, ½ cup of flour, scant.</p>

<p>Let the milk come to a boil. Beat one cup of sugar, flour and eggs until the
mixture is light and creamy, then stir into the boiling milk; cook until the flour is
thoroughly cooked. Set away to cool. When cold whip the cream, add the other
cup of sugar and turn into the cooked mixture and freeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>


<h3>Mince Meat. (<em>Very Nice.</em>)</h3>

<p>One quart of chopped beef, ½ pound of suet, 1 cup of butter, 1 pint of molasses,
2 quarts of chopped apples, 2 cups of raisins, 2 pounds of maple sugar, 1 tablespoonful
each of cloves, allspice and cinnamon.</p>

<p>Boil slowly in 2 quarts of sweet cider two or three hours, being careful not to let
it burn.</p>


<h3>Maple Sweet Pickles.</h3>

<p>Seven pounds fruit, 1 pint best maple or cider vinegar, 1 tablespoonful ground
cinnamon, 3 pounds of maple sugar, 1 teaspoonful ground cloves, 1 teaspoonful
ground allspice. Boil until the fruit is tender. This is excellent for plums, pears,
peaches or cucumbers.</p>


<h3>Maple Sugar on Snow.</h3>

<p>For preparing maple sugar for eating on snow, either sugar or syrup may be used,
but the syrup if obtainable, is best. Boil the syrup until, when dropped on snow, it
remains on the surface and becomes waxy, then spread it upon the surface of the
snow or a block of ice. If the sugar is used, add a little water and melt it, being careful
not to burn, and treat in the same manner as the syrup. This will be found, as every
sugar maker knows, one of the most delicious treats obtainable.</p>

<h3>Maple Taffy.</h3>

<p>Place together in the kettle, 2 pounds of maple sugar, 1 pound of brown sugar,
½ pound of glucose and 1 pint of water, and stir until the mixture is dissolved. Boil
until the taffy will snap when tested in cold water, then pour it upon a buttered dish
or slab to cool. The candy may be checked off in squares, or, if preferred, it may be
pulled until white.</p>


<h3>Maple Candy.</h3>

<p>Three cups sugar, 1 cup syrup, ½ cup water. When it comes to a boil put in one
large spoonful of vinegar ¼ teaspoonful of cream of tartar, 1 lump of butter the size
of a walnut. Boil until brittle when dropped into cold water. Pull until light and
dry.</p>

<p>Two cups maple honey, 1 cup sugar, ¼ teaspoonful soda, lump of butter half as
big as an egg. Boil until brittle when dropped in water, and then take off and cool
on plates. When cold, pull and cut up.</p>

<p>Two cups maple sugar, ½ cup of water, 1 tablespoonful vinegar. Boil until it
will be crumpy when dropped in cold water. Turn on buttered plates; when cool
enough, pull and cut into sticks.</p>


<h3>Maple Cream Without Cream.</h3>

<p>No. 1. Place in a batter bowl the whites of two eggs and two cups of the best
maple syrup. Whip these together with an egg-beater or fork, and then throw in
enough XXX confectioners’ sugar to thicken sufficiently to mould into shapes.
Coat with either chocolate or plain cream.</p>

<p>No. 2. Mix two pounds of maple sugar, a fourth of a teaspoonful of cream of
tartar and a cup of water, and boil until a little of the syrup will form a “soft ball”
when tried in water. Set it away in the kettle until almost cold, and then work it
with the paddle until it becomes creamy or cloudy, when pour immediately into a
shallow tin pan. When cold, turn the pan upside down, when the cream will drop
out. Divide into blocks.</p>

<h3>Maple Cream.</h3>

<p>Two cups of maple sugar, one-half cup of cream. Let it boil until it hairs then
stir in one cup of nuts, butternuts preferable.</p>

<p>Pour into buttered tins and when nearly cold cut in squares.</p>


<h3>Maple Sugar Fudge.</h3>

<p>Two cups of white sugar. One cup of maple sugar, two-thirds cup of sweet
milk. Cook twelve minutes after it begins to boil. Remove from the stove and add
a piece of butter size of a walnut and 1 cup of walnut meats. Stir until it thickens
then pour into a buttered tin. When nearly cold cut in squares.</p>


<h3>Maple Sugar Candy.</h3>

<p>Two pint bowls maple sugar, 1 pint bowl white sugar, 1 pint bowl of water, two
or three tablespoons whipped cream, one large coffee cup butternuts. Place kettle
with the sugar and water in it on back of the stove until sugar is dissolved then draw
forward and boil until the soft ball stage is reached (being careful not to stir the sugar
after it commences to boil). Remove to a cool place until nearly cold before stirring.
When partly grained add whipped cream, turn into tins and set in a cool place to
harden.</p>


<h3>Nut Candy.</h3>

<p>Nice maple sugar with sufficient water to dissolve it, 1 tablespoonful of vinegar
to 2 pounds of sugar, and butter size of walnut. Boil until very hard when tried in
water. Pour immediately into a buttered pan in which the nuts have been placed.
Cut into sticks before cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>


<h3>Maple Opera Caramels.</h3>

<p>Measure a cup and a half each of coffee and maple sugar, one cupful of cream,
and a fourth of a small teaspoonful of cream of tartar, and boil the cream and sugar
together, adding the cream of tartar, wet with a little cream, as soon as the syrup
reaches the boiling point. Cook until a drop of syrup, lifted out on the point of a
skewer and dropped into very cold water, may be rolled into a soft, creamy ball
between the fingers. Care must be taken to stir the syrup incessantly, and also that
the bottom of the pan or kettle does not come into direct contact with the fire, as the
cream is very apt to scorch. When done, remove from the fire, flavor, and pour on
a slab, sprinkled with a very little water. When cold, cream the candy as directed
for fondant, and as soon as perfectly smooth, form into a sheet half an inch thick,
using the rolling pin. Let it remain on the slab a few hours, when divide into strips
and wrap in parafin paper.</p>


<h3>Maple Molasses Cocoanut Squares.</h3>

<p>Place in the kettle a scanty cupful of new maple molasses and a tablespoonful
of butter, and, when boiling add a grated cocoanut. Cook over a slow fire, stirring
until done. As soon as the hot candy will harden when dropped into cold water,
pour it out upon a well buttered slab; and when hardened sufficiently cut it into
squares and wrap in parafin paper.</p>


<h3>Pulled Taffy.</h3>

<p>Take three cupfuls of dry maple sugar, a cupful of vinegar and water in equal
parts (one-third vinegar and two-thirds water may be used if the vinegar is very
strong) and a piece of butter the size of a walnut. Boil the sugar, water and vinegar
together until half done, then add the butter, stirring only enough to incorporate the
butter thoroughly, and boil until done. Drop a little of the candy now and then into
cold water and test by pulling it apart; if it snaps it is done and must be immediately
poured upon a buttered dish to cool. Flavor with a little vanilla extract poured upon
the top. When the taffy has cooled sufficiently to handle, it may be pulled, cut into
short lengths and placed on buttered dishes or parafin paper.</p>


<h3>Popped Corn and Nut Candy.</h3>

<p>Take a tablespoonful of butter, three of water and one cupful of maple sugar;
boil until it is ready to candy and then add three quarts of nicely popped corn. Stir
briskly until the mixture is evenly distributed over the corn. Keep up the stirring
until it cools when each kernel will be separately coated. Close and undivided attention
may be necessary to the success of this kind of candy. Nuts are delicious prepared
by this method.</p>


<h3>Hoarhound Candy.</h3>

<p>To a quart of water add a small single handful of hoarhound herbs and boil for
about half an hour. Strain and press all the liquor from the herbs. Place on the
fire and add to this liquid three pounds of maple sugar. When it boils add half a
teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Test, and when it reaches the “hard crack” or 290
degrees, add a piece of butter as large as a hulled walnut. When the butter is dissolved,
pour the whole mass on a marble slab or onto a greased platter. When almost
cold mark into squares with a knife.</p>


<h3>Molasses Candy.</h3>

<p>Two cups of maple molasses, 2 teaspoonfuls of butter, 1 cup of maple sugar,
½ cup of water.</p>

<p>Boil all together until done,—be careful not to stir while cooking. When
done, pull.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs150">“A Sweet Little Story”</p>

<hr class="r20">

<p>The Vermont Maple Sugar Maker’s Association was born in
January, 1894. G. H. Grimm, at that convention, made the first display
of high grade Maple Sugar and Syrup, winning first prize, then and
there after, for years in succession, until Sugar Makers became sufficiently
interested to make exhibits worthy of the industry.</p>

<p>Thereafter, the Grimm exhibits were wholly confined to utensils
for producing a high grade quality of maple sweets. Grimm utensils
won the highest awards of the Association in 1894, 1895, 1896, 1897,
1898, 1899, 1901, 1904 and 1905. In the three years omitted, Grimm
exhibits were not in competition.</p>

<p>The Grimm Evaporator and Grimm Sap Spout is more extensively
used by up-to-date Sugar Makers than any other make. More
Grimm Evaporators are annually sold than the combined output of all
competitors. I will forfeit $500.00 if this statement is not absolutely
true. Competitors are invited to investigate, order books are at their
disposal. The Grimm Spout has benefited the Sugar Maker and the
Maple tree, more than any other article in the Sugar Bush. If you
desire first quality, the Grimm Evaporator is in a class by itself. Ask
those who have used it for nearly thirty years. Addresses can be had
for the asking.</p>

<p>The Grimm Evaporator is made with or without Syphons, and with
the latest improvements, no other evaporator can evaporate sap faster
nor make as good a quality of product as the Improved Grimm Evaporator.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs150 bold wsp">Williams Bellows Falls Evaporators</p>

<p class="no-indent">are commonly admitted superior to every other appliance for
evaporating maple sap. Best maple sugar makers throughout
the state and country prefer the Williams Bellows Falls
Evaporator for these superior features:</p>

<p>1st.—<b>Simplicity.</b> There is a free flow of sap from end to
end. No need of siphons. They are easy to tend, easy to
handle and cannot burn the bottom if left with a fire in the
arch.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp75" id="image046" style="max-width: 55.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image046.jpg" alt="Evaporators">
</figure>

<p>2nd.—<b>Durability.</b> These evaporators are made of galvanized
iron, tin plate or copper, tin plated. The material
is the highest quality obtainable, and the evaporator will
keep its shape with long service. “It is almost impossible to
wear them out.”</p>

<p>3rd.—<b>Double Heating Surface.</b> The crimps, which run
crosswise, are pressed from the same sheet metal as the bottom.
As they are open underneath, they not only prevent the heat
passing up the chimney, but give double the heating surface
of other pans.</p>

<p>4th.—<b>Cost.</b> Heating surface considered, the Williams
is the cheapest evaporator made. Our catalogue gives the
price of any size evaporator as well as of all other sugar makers
supplies.</p>

prices. Try us.</b></p>
